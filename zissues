FEATURES description

Giftcard Transfer
------------------
This functionality involves two users, both will be referred to as
"reciever" and "sender" in his description
What the reciever does: 
> generates the address
> the to-be reciever of the yet-to-be-created giftcard
creates an address into which the giftcard will be sent.
> the address is generated using custom jwt function where
the payload is signed with a private key/OTP
> the private key is generated by the automatically using the otp-generator
library, it is then sent to the user using a yet-to-be-decided SMS service
> the user provides this OTP on request to generate the address
> this generated address and the reciever's username are to be forwarded
by the reciever to the potential sender

what the sender does:
> sends the giftcard
> the sender is required to provide the address and username
of the reciever on request to send giftcard then his password
> the password is compared to the sender's hashed password in the db to confirm match
> an error of "incorrect password" is appropriately thrown if no match if found
> the username is used to verify if the to-be reciever exists on db
> the address is used to verify if the now found to-be-reciever created the address
> when all is verified, the formerly undefined holder property of
the giftcard collection on the db is assigned with the reciever's id

conclusion
1) before giftcard is transfered:
> a read giftcard request from the sender's account
will capture the giftcard because he created it and therefore the current holder
> a read giftcard request from the reciever's account
will not capture the giftcard

2) after giftcard is transfered:
> a read giftcard request from the sender's account
will no longer capture the giftcard because he is no longer the holder
> a read giftcard request from the reciever's account
will now capture the giftcard because he has now been assigned as current holder

3) all errors thrown in the process of giftcard transfer are captured
and sent to client
